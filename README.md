# CS_Lab_5: Cryptography Algorithms in Python

Welcome to CS_Lab_5! This repository is dedicated to demonstrating the implementation of various cryptography algorithms in Python. It's an excellent resource for anyone interested in understanding the basics of cryptographic techniques and their implementation.

## Algorithms Covered

1. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm**: 
   - [diffie-helman_algorithm.py](https://github.com/Ricigeroi/CS_Lab_5/blob/master/diffie-helman_algorithm.py)
   - This script demonstrates the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange mechanism, a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel.

2. **ElGamal Encryption Algorithm**: 
   - [elgamal_algorithm.py](https://github.com/Ricigeroi/CS_Lab_5/blob/master/elgamal_algorithm.py)
   - This file contains an implementation of the ElGamal Encryption Algorithm, which is widely used for public-key cryptography.

3. **RSA Algorithm**: 
   - [rsa_algorithm.py](https://github.com/Ricigeroi/CS_Lab_5/blob/master/rsa_algorithm.py)
   - Here, you'll find an implementation of the RSA algorithm, one of the first public-key cryptosystems and widely used for secure data transmission.
